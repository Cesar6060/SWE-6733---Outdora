### Backlog Rationale 

Link to backlog: https://outdora-project.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1/backlog

The backlog is ordered starting with the login page and ending with the messaging page and functionality. The UI, backend and database can be done simultaneously so there is no order for which is done first. However, login should be handled first since itâ€™s the first thing the user will interact with and single sign on should be developed after. Next the user will create a profile and choose preferences (matching criteria) so these features come next including the profile photo upload functionality. Next is the matching algorithm and the UI for the users to match with each other. Lastly, once the user is matched they will need to message each other, so messaging functionality and UI will come last.
