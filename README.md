## Product Vision

### Far Vision:
Outdora aims to revolutionize the way adventure enthusiasts connect, explore, and share their passion for the outdoors. Our goal is to create a global community where individuals can find like-minded partners for any outdoor activity, fostering meaningful connections based on shared interests and skill levels. 

### Near Vision:
In the near term, Outdora will provide a robust and user-friendly mobile application that matches users based on their specific adventure preferences, skill levels, and geographic proximity. Our immediate focus is to develop key features such as user profiles, adventure preferences, in-app messaging, and a swipe-based matching system, laying a strong foundation for future growth and enhancements.
 
### Backlog Rationale 

Link to backlog: https://outdora-project.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/SCRUM/boards/1/backlog

The backlog is ordered starting with the login page and ending with the messaging page and functionality. The UI, backend and database can be done simultaneously so there is no order for which is done first. However, login should be handled first since itâ€™s the first thing the user will interact with and single sign on should be developed after. Next the user will create a profile and choose preferences (matching criteria) so these features come next including the profile photo upload functionality. Next is the matching algorithm and the UI for the users to match with each other. Lastly, once the user is matched they will need to message each other, so messaging functionality and UI will come last.
